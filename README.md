# Project Overview

## How do I approach designing software?

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project helped me refine my skills in organizing and planning a 3D scene, especially in choosing shapes and materials to create realistic models without relying on specialized 3D software.  I also improved my ability to visualize scenes before coding, which helped me think through each object’s role and design choices early on.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process began with listing the objects I wanted to recreate.  I sketched a basic layout of the scene to understand the placements and proportions and planned the textures and materials that would make each item stand out.  Then, I broke down each part of the scene into smaller tasks, creating each object step-by-step.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This design approach breaking down a project into smaller, manageable steps and sketching will help in future projects.  Whether in computer graphics or other software design, starting with a solid plan and visual reference is valuable for creating clear and organized code.

## How do I approach developing programs?

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used incremental development for this project, focusing on one part of the scene at a time.  By building one object and testing it before moving to the next, I can catch and fix issues early, making the overall development process smoother.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential, especially when refining each object’s shape and material.  By making small adjustments and testing frequently, I could improve the look and fit of each part within the whole scene, leading to a more polished result.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
With each milestone, I became more organized and systematic in my approach to coding. I learned to document my work better and to break down problems into smaller tasks, making it easier to keep track of progress and address issues. This approach improved my efficiency and helped me complete the project on time.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics introduced me to new ways of thinking about objects, materials, and space.  This experience gave me practical skills in using OpenGL and a deeper understanding of how visuals are created in software, which will be valuable in any further studies related to graphics or game development.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The skills I developed in creating realistic visuals and understanding how shapes and textures work together are highly useful for a career in software development, especially in fields like game design, animation, or simulations.  This project has also strengthened my problem solving skills and my ability to approach tasks systematically, both of which are essential in any tech career.
